<h1>Call for Papers</h1>

<br>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">The 9<sup>th</sup> Asia-Pacific Workshop on Networking (APNet’25) will be held in Shanghai, China on August 7-8, 2025. Building on the success of its predecessors, APNet’25 will continue to bring together the very best researchers in computer networking and systems across the Asia-Pacific region and around the globe to a live forum discussing innovative ideas at their early stages. The mission of APNet is that promising but not-yet-mature ideas can receive timely feedback from the community and experienced researchers, leading them into publications at major conferences such as SIGCOMM, NSDI, SOSP, OSDI, EuroSys, MobiCom, and CoNEXT.</p>

<br>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">We invite submissions of papers <font color="red">(up to 6 pages, excluding references)</font> on a wide range of networking research, including, but not limited to:</p>
				<ul class="custom-list">
  <li style="font-style: italic;">Network architectures and algorithms</li>
  <li style="font-style: italic;">Cloud and wide-area networking systems &amp; infrastructure</li>
  <li style="font-style: italic;">Networking for Machine Learning and Machine Learning for Networking</li>
  <li style="font-style: italic;">Operating system support for networking</li>
  <li style="font-style: italic;">High-speed networking and applications</li>
  <li style="font-style: italic;">Domain-specific networks including datacenter, storage, intra-host networks, etc.</li>
  <li style="font-style: italic;">SDN, NFV, and network programming</li>
  <li style="font-style: italic;">Networking hardware design and application</li>
  <li style="font-style: italic;">Network measurement, monitoring, diagnosis, and operations</li>
  <li style="font-style: italic;">Formal methods and network verification</li>
  <li style="font-style: italic;">Network security and privacy, censorship, transparency</li>
  <li style="font-style: italic;">Network, transport, and application-layer protocols</li>
  <li style="font-style: italic;">Resource management, QoS, and signaling</li>
  <li style="font-style: italic;">Routing, traffic engineering, switching, and addressing</li>
  <li style="font-style: italic;">Wireless, mobile, and sensor networking</li>
  <li style="font-style: italic;">Programmable End Host (e.g., eBPF, SmartNics)</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">The APNet Technical Program Committee will evaluate submissions based on their novelty, significance, and technical merit, rather than completeness. Innovative and well-reasoned ideas supported by preliminary evaluations are sufficient for APNet. We encourage authors to further develop their APNet papers with robust implementations and experiments, aiming for publication in the aforementioned premier conferences.</p>

<h2>APC Burden Reduction (ABR) Program</h2>
<br>
    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">Following recent changes in ACM's publication policies for the International Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS), authors affiliated with institutions that are not part of the ACM Open program (<a href="https://libraries.acm.org/acmopen/open-participants" target="_blank">libraries.acm.org/acmopen/open-participants</a>) and do not qualify for a waiver must pay an article processing charge (APC) to publish their ICPS article in the ACM Digital Library.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">To help mitigate this financial burden, <b>APNet’25 is introducing the APC Burden Reduction (ABR) Program</b>, which provides <b>a free full conference registration</b> as partial compensation for the APC cost.</p>

<h3>Eligibility Criteria</h3>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Authors may apply for the ABR Program if they meet all of the following conditions:</p>
    <ul class="custom-list">
        <li>The paper has been officially accepted as a <b>regular paper</b> at APNet’25.</li>
        <li>The corresponding author’s institution is <b>not</b> listed in the <a href="https://libraries.acm.org/acmopen/open-participants">ACM Open Participant List</a>.</li>
        <li>A formal APC waiver request has been <b>submitted to ACM and rejected</b>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Application Process</h3>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Eligible authors must provide verification of all three conditions and submit the required documentation via email to <a href="mailto:senliu@fudan.edu.cn">senliu@fudan.edu.cn</a>.</p>

<h2>Information of China’s Visa-Free Policies</h2>
<br>
    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">We are pleased to announce that many countries are eligible for visa-free entry to Shanghai, making it easier for you to attend the APNet 2025 conference. For the latest information on China’s visa-free travel policies, please refer to the following links:

<h2>Important Note to Authors about ACM Open Access Publishing Model</h2>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">We are pleased to announce that APNET 2025 will participate in the ACM Open initiative, transitioning to a 100% Open Access publishing model starting January 1, 2026. This change aims to enhance the accessibility and impact of research published in the ACM Digital Library. Authors submitting papers to APNET must either be affiliated with an ACM Open institution, pay the applicable Article Processing Charge (APC), or qualify for an automatic or discretionary waiver. Detailed information regarding the Open Access model and associated fees can be found on the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/openaccess">ACM website</a>. We encourage authors to review this information carefully to ensure a smooth submission process. For any inquiries, please reach out to <a href="mailto:acmopen@hq.acm.org">acmopen@hq.acm.org</a>.</p>

<h2>Submission Instructions</h2>
				<!--<p><b><a href="https://apnet24.hotcrp.com">https://apnet24.hotcrp.com</a> is open for registration and submission.</b></p>-->
				<!-- <p><b><a href="https://apnet24.hotcrp.com">https://apnet24.hotcrp.com</a> is open now.</b></p> -->

                <br>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;">Submissions must be no longer than 6 pages in length including all content except references, formatted in standard ACM two-column conference style with 10-pt font size. Authors should consult the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM website</a> for the up to date template. Reviewing will be double-blind: no author or affiliation information should appear in the submission. The authors should additionally follow the best practice in order not to disclose their identities implicitly. Papers may present preliminary results but must include novel ideas and differ significantly from previously published work. In line with standard scholarly practices, authors should not have substantially similar work under review elsewhere. However, an extended version of the APNet submission, with a complete implementation and additional experiments, can be submitted simultaneously to another venue. Accepted papers will appear in the proceedings of the workshop, which will be published in the ACM Digital Library.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">Submissions can be made online at <a href="https://apnet25.hotcrp.com">https://apnet25.hotcrp.com/</a>.</p>
